# Tactile Sensor Interface
This repo is based on an early, simplified version of a user interface for an underwater robotic grasping mechanism using video feed and tactile sensing information.
This version uses a microservice implemented seperately to check user input, as part of the CS361 Final Project Requirements.

## Limitations
This project requires playing videos that are not uploaded on this repo, and must be downloaded seperately.
